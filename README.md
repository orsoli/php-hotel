### Description: 
**We start from this array of hotels
[("Array")](https://www.codepile.net/pile/OEWY7Q1G).
Print all our hotels with all the available data.
Start gradually.
First, print the data on the page without worrying about the style.
Then, add Bootstrap and display the information using a table.**

### Bonus:

**1. Add a form at the beginning of the page that, via a GET request, allows filtering hotels that have parking.**

**2. Add a second field to the form that allows filtering hotels by rating (e.g., enter 3 and get all hotels that have a rating of three stars or higher).**

### Solution:
- Copy the array hotel's details in php
- Print in page all array details
- Use bootstrap for styles the results using a table
